title: 分析G1 GC日志
tags: Java
---


测试环境：

> `jdk1.8`，`win10`，4核8线程，`16G`内存

演示代码：程序在1秒内生成许多对象，每个对象随机放在数组里。有的位置就会被重置，就会存在未被使用的对象，等待被回收。

```java
import java.util.Random;
import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit;
import java.util.concurrent.atomic.LongAdder;
/*
演示GC日志生成与解读
*/
public class GCLogAnalysis {
    private static Random random = new Random();
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // 当前毫秒时间戳
        long startMillis = System.currentTimeMillis();
        // 持续运行毫秒数; 可根据需要进行修改
        long timeoutMillis = TimeUnit.SECONDS.toMillis(1);
        // 结束时间戳
        long endMillis = startMillis + timeoutMillis;
        LongAdder counter = new LongAdder();
        System.out.println("正在执行...");
        // 缓存一部分对象; 进入老年代
        int cacheSize = 2000;
        Object[] cachedGarbage = new Object[cacheSize];
        // 在此时间范围内,持续循环
        while (System.currentTimeMillis() < endMillis) {
            // 生成垃圾对象
            Object garbage = generateGarbage(100*1024);
            counter.increment();
            int randomIndex = random.nextInt(2 * cacheSize);
            if (randomIndex < cacheSize) {
                cachedGarbage[randomIndex] = garbage;
            }
        }
        System.out.println("执行结束!共生成对象次数:" + counter.longValue());
    }

    // 生成对象
    private static Object generateGarbage(int max) {
        int randomSize = random.nextInt(max);
        int type = randomSize % 4;
        Object result = null;
        switch (type) {
            case 0:
                result = new int[randomSize];
                break;
            case 1:
                result = new byte[randomSize];
                break;
            case 2:
                result = new double[randomSize];
                break;
            default:
                StringBuilder builder = new StringBuilder();
                String randomString = "randomString-Anything";
                while (builder.length() < randomSize) {
                    builder.append(randomString);
                    builder.append(max);
                    builder.append(randomSize);
                }
                result = builder.toString();
                break;
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```

编译代码：

```java
javac GCLogAnalysis.java
```

`G1 – Garbage First`(垃圾优先算法)，`G1 GC`最主要的设计目标是： 将`STW`停顿的时间和分布变成可预期以及可配置。

`G1`适合大内存，需要低延迟的场景。`G1 GC`的日志信息太多了，这里只给出一种配置进行分析。

案例（` -Xms4g -Xmx4g`）

对`G1 GC`日志中的字段进行解释：

- `[GC pause (G1 Evacuation Pause) (young), 0.0099569 secs]`:`G1`转移暂停，只清理年轻代空间。持续的系统时间为`0.0099569`秒 。
- `[Parallel Time: 7.9 ms, GC Workers: 8]`：表明后面的活动由8个 `Worker` 线程并行执行, 消耗时间为`7.9`毫秒。
- `GC Worker Start (ms)`：相对于 pause 开始的时间戳，`GC`的`worker`线程开始启动所用时间。如果 `Min `和 `Max `差别很大，则表明本机其他进程所使用的线程数量过多， 挤占了`GC`的`CPU`时间。
- `Ext Root Scanning (ms)`：用了多长时间来扫描堆外(`non-heap`)的`root`， 如`classloaders`, `JNI`引用, `JVM`的系统`root`等。后面显示了运行时间, “Sum” 指的是`CPU`时间。
- `Update RS (ms)`：更新`Remembered Sets`使用的时间。
- `Processed Buffers`：每个` worker `线程处理了多少个本地缓冲区(`local buffer`)。
- `Scan RS (ms)`：用了多长时间扫描来自`RSet`的引用。
- `Code Root Scanning (ms)`：用了多长时间来扫描实际代码中的 `root`。
- `Object Copy (ms)`：用了多长时间来拷贝收集区内的存活对象。
- `Termination (ms)`：`GC`的`worker`线程用了多长时间来确保自身可以安全地停止， 这段时间什么也不用做， `stop `之后该线程就终止运行了。
- `Termination Attempts`：`GC`的`worker` 线程尝试多少次 `try` 和` teminate`。如果`worker`发现还有一些任务没处理完，则这一次尝试就是失败的， 暂时还不能终止。
- `GC Worker Other (ms)`：处理一些琐碎的小活动所用的时间，在`GC`日志中不值得单独列出来。
- `GC Worker Total (ms)`：`GC`的`worker` 线程的工作时间总计。
- `GC Worker End (ms)`：相对于 `pause `开始的时间戳，`GC`的`worker `线程完成作业的时间。通常来说这部分数字应该大致相等， 否则就说明有太多的线程被挂起， 很可能是因为坏邻居效应(`noisy neighbor`) 所导致的。
- `Code Root Fixup`：释放用于管理并行活动的内部数据。一般都接近于零。这是串行执行的过程。
- `Code Root Purge`：清理其他部分数据， 也是非常快的，但如非必要则几乎等于零。这是串行执行的过程。
- `Clear CT`：清理 `card table` 中` cards `的时间。清理工作只是简单地删除“脏”状态， 此状态用来标识一个字段是否被更新的， 供`Remembered Sets`使用。
- `Other`：其他活动消耗的时间， 其中有很多也是并行执行的。
- `Choose CSet`：选择`CSet`使用时间，`CSet`是指`Collection Set`，和`RSet(Remembered Set)`一样，用于辅助`GC`，用空间换时间。
- `Ref Proc`：处理非强引用(`non-strong`)的时间: 进行清理或者决定是否需要清理。
- `Ref Enq`：用来将剩下的 `non-strong `引用排列到合适的 `ReferenceQueue`中。
- `Redirty Cards`：重新脏化卡片。排队引用可能会更新`RSet`，所以需要对关联的`Card`重新脏化。
- `Humongous Register`和`Humongous Reclaim`：主要是对巨型对象回收的信息，`youngGC`阶段会对`RSet`中有引用的短命的巨型对象进行回收，巨型对象会直接回收而不需要进行转移（转移代价巨大，也没必要）。
- `Free CSet`：释放`CSet`中的`region`到`free list`使用时间。
- `Eden: 204.0M(204.0M)->0.0B(178.0M) Survivors: 0.0B->26.0M Heap: 204.0M(4096.0M)->65.2M(4096.0M)`：暂停之前和暂停之后， Eden 区的使用量/总容量。 暂停之前和暂停之后， 存活区的使用量。暂停之前和暂停之后， 整个堆内存的使用量与总容量。
- `Times: user=0.00 sys=0.00, real=0.01 secs`： `GC`事件的持续时间, 通过三个部分（用户线程，系统调用， 应用程序暂停的时间）来衡量。

小结：

- `G1`是一个有整理内存过程的垃圾收集器，不会产生很多内存碎片。
- 在实现高吞吐量的同时，`G1`的`Stop The World(STW)`更可控，在停顿时间上添加了预测机制，用户可以指定期望停顿时间。
- `G1`能与应用程序线程并发执行。
